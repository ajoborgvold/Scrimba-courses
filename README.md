# Scrimba courses

As part of the team of freelance coding teachers at Scrimba, I create course content for the Scrimba learning platform. The courses are video-based yet interactive due to the brilliant Scrimba environment where IDE and streaming have been merged into one, allowing students to pause videos and jump straight into the teachers code and play around with it.

I have created a course that teaches the command-line fundamentals through a combination of theory and hands-on excersices. The course is an integrated part of the Scrimba full-stack developer career path and is also available, for free, as a stand-alone course right here: [Command Line Basics](https://scrimba.com/command-line-basics-c08b87ogl0)

In the very near future, Scrimba will launch a new back-end developer career path, featuring the existing Command Line Basics course + a new section packed with CLI challenges that I am currently working on.
