# Published coding courses

As part of the team of freelance coding teachers at Scrimba, I create course content for the Scrimba learning platform. The courses are video-based yet interactive due to the brilliant Scrimba environment where IDE and streaming have been merged into one, allowing students to pause videos and jump straight into the teachers code and play around with it.

I have created a course that teaches the command-line fundamentals through a combination of theory and hands-on excersices. The course is an integrated part of the Scrimba full-stack developer career path and is also available, for free, as a stand-alone course right here: [Command Line Basics](https://scrimba.com/command-line-basics-c08b87ogl0)

Scrimba's back-end developer career path featurs both the existing Command Line Basics course and a new section of mine packed with CLI challenges (available for paying users only).

## Scrimba Teacher Talent Program

As part of Scrimba's Teacher Talent Program, I produced a coding course teaching React.js and web accessibility through building a memory game. Check out the course on Scrimba right here: [Build a Memory Game in React - Scrimba edition](https://scrimba.com/memory-game-in-react-c0a3odsk39)

The memory game course is also available on the freeCodeCamp YouTube channel: [Build a Memory Game in React - freeCodeCamp edition](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-a-memory-game-in-react/)
